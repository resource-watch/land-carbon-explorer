The NASA GEDI is a spaceborne lidar instrument operating onboard the International Space Station since April 2019. It provides point-based measurements of vegetation structure between 52\xb0N and 52\xb0S globally [(Dubayah et al., 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666017220300018). The GEDI relative height of returned energy (RH) metrics were filtered to exclude low quality observations and gridded to the Landsat 30-m spatial resolution. he RH metrics were compared with 90th percentile of the forest height at 30-m pixel resolution derived from the airborne lidar instruments and found that the GEDI RH95 (relative height at 95%) metric is highly correlated with the airborne lidar canopy height product. This metric was selected as the calibration data for the global forest height map. To exclude non-woody vegetation from the training,  a zero height was assigned to all GEDI observations with RH95 values below 3 meters.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\n  \\nA global 16-day normalized surface reflectance Landsat ARD was employed as input data for forest height modeling [(Potapov et al., 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425720305381?via%3Dihub). The per-pixel 16-day time-series data were composed only of clear-sky observations during the snow-free season.  A set of annual multitemporal metrics was generated to provide consistent land surface phenology inputs for model application. To facilitate spatiotemporal consistency of the reflectance time-series, gap-filling of the missing 16-day data with data from preceding years was implemented. Annual metrics include selected ranks, inter-rank averages, and amplitudes of surface reflectance and vegetation indices values, and surface reflectance averages for land surface phenology stages defined by vegetation indices (i.e., surface reflectance for the maximum and minimum greenness periods). The Landsat metrics were augmented with elevation data.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\n  \\nThe2019 GEDI RH95 was used as a dependent variable and the Landsat multitemporal metrics from the same year as independent variables to calibrate the regression tree ensembles. A separate model was calibrated for each Landsat ARD tile (1\xd71\xb0) using training data collected within the neighboring tiles. The prototype for the boreal forest height map, where GEDI data were absent (north of 52\xb0N), was calibrated using training data extracted from the modeled forest height between 40\xb0N and 52\xb0N. To address the overestimation of tree height over wetlands and tundra, additional non-forest training was manually collected in areas indicated as treeless by the year 2010 tree canopy cover product (Hansen et al., 2013).\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\n  \\nThe model calibrated for the year 2019 was applied to the multitemporal metrics for other years (2000-2003 and 2017-2020). The forest height value for the years 2000 and 2020 was calculated as the median of 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2017, 2019, 2020, respectively, unless forest loss was indicated by the forest change product [(Hansen et al., 2013)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24233722/). To reduce errors and noise in the model outputs due to remaining atmospheric contamination and differences in the radiometric resolution of Landsat sensors in 2000 and 2020, extensive filtering of the output products was implemented. Pixels that did not experience forest loss according to the Hansen et al. (2013) product and that had an overlap of ranges of forest height values for 2000-2003 and 2017-2020 intervals were considered stable forests. Manual masks were also used to clean up incorrectly mapped forest loss and gain, especially in the short seasonal forests. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the full documentation, please click on the \u201cLearn more\u201d button.\\r\\n  \\n  \\n### Additional Information  \\n  \\nResource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset.

The GLAD laboratory classified all available Landsat 5, 7, and 8 scenes. Each scene was classified per pixel to identify land, water, and ground obscured by cloud, shadow, haze, or ice. Land and water observations were summed by month from all available images. These counts were aggregated to estimate the annual temporal percent of the year each pixel had water presence, resulting in values of 0-100, and pixels with no observations a no-data value of 255. In order to characterize the type of surface water dynamic over the 22 years, the annual water percent was estimated for each year and temporally filtered to provide greater consistency. A series of rules were applied to this time series to characterize it into permanent land or water, stable seasonal, unidirectional loss or gain, temporary dry or wet period, and high-frequency transitions between annual states of water and land. These classes are mapped both as discrete classes and as a continuum representing the class and percent water. \\n  \\n  \\nThe Global Land Analysis and Discovery Lab (GLAD) laboratory in the Department of Geographical Sciences at UMD investigates methods, causes, and impacts of global land surface change.

GLAD aspires to generate new science insights concerning land resources, educate the next generation of remote sensing-based land change scientists, and disseminate land monitoring capabilities to operational settings nationally and internationally.\\n  \\n  \\n### Methodology  \\n  \\nOpen surface water, or simply water, is defined as inland water that covers \u226550% of a pixel and is not obscured by objects on or above the water surface, for example, forest canopy, floating aquatic vegetation, bridges, or ice. The analysis had three major steps: (1) classify every Landsat scene 1999-2020; (2) create an annual percent water time-series; and (3) characterize the time-series into various dynamics classes. \\r\\n  \\n  \\nAll Landsat 5, 7, and 8 scenes from 1999-2020 were classified into land, water, and unusable data. Due to the diversity of reflectance patterns for open surface water targets, an ensemble of hierarchical, bagged classification trees were used to discriminate clear observations from those contaminated by cloud, shadow, and ice and to discriminate water from land. These classification trees were developed from a training set of 150-180 fully labeled scenes per sensor [(Potapov et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.11.027). The classification models utilize all the Landsat bands, normalized difference ratios of each pair of spectral bands, and 3x3 pixel spatial averages of all bands and ratios, as well as, utilize topographic inputs of elevation and derived slope, aspect, and hillshade data.\\r\\n  \\n  \\nThe annual water percent time series was derived from the counts of water and land observations. To account for intra-annual variation in clear observation frequency (e.g. fewer observations in the far north in winter due to low sun elevations or in tropical monsoon environments due to high cloud cover), the percent of land and water observations flagged as water (water / (water + land)) was first calculated per meteorological season (December-February, March-May, June-August, September-November) of each year. Then the average water percent of the seasons with data was assigned as the annual water percent. Temporal filters and manual masks were applied to remove noise and omission/commission errors. \\r\\n  \\n  \\nAn inter-annual water dynamics model was developed to characterize and visualize the dynamics of water presence 1999-2020. The annual water percent time series was first smoothed using a 3-year mean moving window, and the range and mean were calculated per pixel. Pixels with a range of \u226433% and a mean of \u226410% or \u226590% were labeled permanent land and water, respectively, providing a stable target with low sensitivity to possible omission or commission effects due to image artifacts or atmospheric conditions. Change pixels were identified as pixels with a range of \u226550%, and all other pixels labeled as stable seasonal, characterized by having little or no inter-annual variation in water presence and consistent intra-annual variation. By an analysis of all local maxima and minima in the time-series, pixels labeled as change were further characterized into the following main change types: gain, loss, dry period (water-land-water), wet period (land-water-land), and high-frequency (3 or more) land-water transitions.

Perennial woody crops, permanent pastures, and shifting cultivation are excluded from the definition. The fallow length is limited to four years for the cropland class. The map is based on the machine learning classification of the global Landsat data archive using locally calibrated models. Model calibration data were collected through visual interpretation of Landsat and high spatial resolution satellite images. The mapping was performed for the 2000-2003 and 2016-2019 time intervals.

Implementation of SDG\u2019s to improve food security, protect freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, and mitigate climate change require national policies and international cooperation that are based on consistent, independent, and timely data on agriculture extent and productivity. The Cropland Extent and Change dataset can serve as a tool for monitoring national and global progress towards SDG\u2019s.\\n\\n  \\n  \\nThe GLAD laboratory in the Department of Geographical Sciences at UMD investigates methods, causes and impacts of global land surface change.

Perennial woody crops, permanent pastures, and shifting cultivation are excluded from the definition. The fallow length is limited to four years for the cropland class. The cropland class definition is largely consistent with the arable land category reported by the [Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/3/Y4171E/Y4171E20.htm).\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\n  \\nThe analysis was performed in four-year epochs, 2000-2003 and 2016-2019. One cropland map per epoch was created, named by the last year of the interval (e.g., the 2019 map represents the 2016-2019 epoch). Using a four-year interval (rather than a single year) increased the number of clear-sky satellite observations in the time-series, which improves the representation of land surface phenology and the accuracy of cropland detection. For each four-year interval, an area was mapped as cropland if a growing crop was detected during any of these years. This way, the criterion of the maximum fallow length was implemented: if an area was not used as cropland for more than four years, it was not included in the cropland map for the corresponding time interval.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\n  \\nThe global 16-day normalized surface reflectance Landsat Analysis Ready Data (Landsat ARD) was employed as input data for cropland mapping [(Potapov et al., 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/3/426). For each four-year interval, a single annualized gap-free 16-day observation time-series was created. For each 16-day interval, the observation with the highest near-infrared reflectance value was selected(to prioritize observations with the highest vegetation cover) from four years of Landsat data. The annualized 16-day time-series within each four-year interval was transformed into a set of multitemporal metrics that provide consistent land surface phenology inputs for global cropland mapping. Metrics include selected ranks, inter-rank averages, and amplitudes of surface reflectance and vegetation indices values, and surface reflectance averages for selected land surface phenology stages defined by vegetation indices (i.e., surface reflectance for the maximum and minimum greenness periods). The Landsat metrics were augmented with elevation data. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\n  \\nGlobal cropland mapping included three stages that enabled extrapolation of visually delineated cropland training data to a temporally consistent global cropland map time-series using machine learning. At all three stages, a bagged decision tree ensembles was employed as a supervised classification algorithm that uses class presence and absence data as the dependent variable and a set of multitemporal metrics as independent variables at a Landsat ARD pixel scale. The first stage consisted of performing individual cropland classifications for a set of 924 Landsat ARD 1\xb0\xd71\xb0 tiles for the 2016-2019 interval. The tiles were chosen to represent diverse global agriculture landscapes. Classification training data (cropland class presence and absence) were manually selected through visual interpretation of Landsat metric composites and high-resolution data from Google Earth. At the second stage, the 924 tiles that had been classified as cropland/other land and the 2016-2019 metric set were used to train a series of regional cropland mapping models. The classification was iterated by adding training tiles and assessing the results until the resulting map was satisfactory. At the third stage, the preliminary global cropland maps were used as training data to generate temporally consistent global cropland data. The goal of this third stage was to create a robust spatiotemporally consistent set of locally calibrated cropland detection models. For each 1\xb0\xd71\xb0 Landsat ARD tile (13,451 tiles total) training data for each four-year interval was collected from the preliminary cropland extent maps within a 3\xb0 radius of the target tile, with preference to select stable cropland and non-cropland pixels as training. Training data from all intervals were used to calibrate a single decision tree ensemble for each ARD tile. The per-tile models were then applied to each time interval, and the results were post-processed to remove single cropland class detections and omissions within time-series and eliminate cropland patches below 0.5 ha. Manual masks to remove map artifacts (e.g., cropland overestimation over temperate wetlands and flooded grasslands) were applied in some regions to improve the final map.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the full documentation, please click on the \u201cLearn more\u201d button.\\r\\n  \\n  \\n### Additional Information  \\n  \\nResource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset.

The map shows the extent of glaciers and perennial snowfields and their change from the year 2000 to 2020. Areas with seasonal snow cover are excluded from the map. The map extent is limited to continents and large islands between 75\xb0N and 56\xb0S [(Potapov et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030426). Greenland, the Antarctic, and Arctic Islands are excluded from the map. Model calibration data were collected through the visual interpretation of Landsat and high spatial resolution satellite images. A set of regionally calibrated models were developed and implemented to map perennial snow and ice cover time-series. The snow/ice loss represents areas where the year 2000 perennial snow or ice cover was transformed into seasonal snow cover or completely disappeared by the year 2020. The gain areas represent the expansion of perennial snowfields and glaciers from the year 2000 to 2020.\\r\\n  \\n  \\nThe GLAD laboratory in the Department of Geographical Sciences at UMD investigates methods, causes, and impacts of global land surface change.  Earth observation imagery is the primary data source, and the land cover extent and change is the primary topic of interest. GLAD aspires to generate new science insights concerning land resources, educate the next generation of remote sensing-based land change scientists, and disseminate land monitoring capabilities to operational settings nationally and internationally.\\r\\n  \\n  \\n### Methodology  \\n  \\nThe source mapped permanent snow and ice using regionally calibrated supervised classification models (decision tree ensembles). The classification model was calibrated with manually collected training data from multitemporal Landsat metrics. The source used the Landsat data from the years 2000, 2005, and 2020 for training data collection. For each year, The source selected Landsat observations during the peak land surface temperature and peak vegetation index values to separate perennial and annual snow cover. The training data from different years were integrated and used to create a single regional model. Overall, the source created fourteen regional models, one model per mountain system or a geographic region. The source iterated the models until the results were sufficiently correct. The final product was filtered using a set of rules to remove noise in the time series and possible omission/commission due to the remaining cloud/cloud shadow contamination of Landsat data.\\n  \\n  \\nFor the full documentation, please click on the \u201cLearn more\u201d button.  \\n  \\n### Additional Information  \\n  \\nResource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset.

The year 2000 map overestimated the area of perennial snow and ice due to the inclusion of seasonal snow and classification errors within topographic shadows. As a result, the rate of snow and ice reduction from the year 2000 to 2020 is overestimated by the map. The areas of snow and ice gain and loss should be considered as indicator products. \\r\\n  \\n  \\n - The product quality depends on the availability of Landsat data during the hottest time of the year.

Alert dates represent the instance of detection, though tree cover loss could have taken place earlier, possibly weeks earlier, due to persistent cloud cover. In this data set, \u201ctree cover\u201d is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 m in height with greater than 60% canopy cover and may take the form of natural forests or plantations. \u201cTree cover loss\u201d indicates the canopy removal of at least half a pixel and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. As such, \u201closs\u201d does not equate to deforestation. In Peru, where the alert system was first developed, the authors evaluated the data to have 13.5% false positives (loss detected where none occurred), though the majority of those false positives (9.5%) occurs on the edges of clearings. On edges, the 30 m Landsat pixels show a mix of forest and other land cover, which makes them prone to error in the system. The rate of false positives drops to 1% when only considering confirmed alerts. The data have 33% false negatives (undetected loss where it has occurred), though most of these occur in secondary forests\u2014likely because the algorithm was created to capture primary forest loss. The higher rate of false negatives compared to false positives also indicates that the alerts are a conservative estimate of the tree cover loss that is actually occurring. When zoomed out, this data layer displays some degree of inaccuracy because the data points must be collapsed to be visible on a larger scale.
